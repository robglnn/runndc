## Active Context

### Current Focus
- MVP code baseline is complete: Function Health–style UI, `/api/calc` pipeline (RxNorm + FDA integration, SIG parsing, quantity/overfill logic), global error modal, demo presets, README, and green `pnpm check`/`pnpm test`.
- Deployment preparation underway via Vercel GitHub import flow.

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Push latest code to GitHub and import the repo into Vercel (project name likely `runndc`).
2. Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel (Preview + Production) during import.
3. Trigger first production deployment, obtain live URL, and share back for README/Memory Bank updates.
4. Smoke-test the deployed app with the five synthetic scenarios and capture demo collateral/screenshots.

### Open Questions / Dependencies
- Awaiting Vercel project creation + live URL from user before finalizing documentation and closing deployment tasks.
- Post-deploy validation: confirm Function Health visual QA/copy tweaks once hosted version is live.
